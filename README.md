My Code Louisville FEWD project is a signup page for the theoretical website of the Trail Life USA troop I am beginning in the fall in Shelbyville. 

Just one page of a larger website, I thought the signup page would give me an opportunity to display a lot of different elements of web development.

The "Home," "Contact," and "About" nav links go to unfinished pages of the site.
Feel free to pretend they are finished!
